## Do you have an innovative idea how to use Cardano?

Well, there's a lot of folks who would love to hear your idea.

[Project Catalyst](https://cardano.ideascale.com/) essentially elevates the cardano community into a bona-fide decentralized, decision-making, governing entity.

### If you've got a great idea, you can get funding to make it a reality.

But before you present your pitch to the greater community, but you need to come correct.

Here's what you'll need to prepare:

- A well thought out problem statement
- A solution that does a great job of addressing it
- A plan in as much detail as possible
- As many supporting links and documents as you can manage

### From there, the Cardano community will vote on whether or not to fund your proposal.

But it's not about winning or losing!

Simply participating is a great oppotunity to learn and grow in the incredible Cardano ecosystem.

So head on over to check it out today!
