## "A place of deep learning, for sound."

# 音 "Oto" + 道場 "Dojo"

You're probably familiar with the Japanese concept of a Dojo, even if you've never seen its written characters.

The image of a "sound dojo" is the driving idea behind the creation of [Otodjo Nodes](https://www.otodojonodes.xyz/).

The project is headed up by futurist tech entrepenuer [Ryu Goto](https://twitter.com/RealRyuGoto) and artist [Otodojo](https://www.instagram.com/otodojo/).

Today they are preparing for the release of their first even token-based collection "Uzumaki"

Check out their [announcement trailer](https://youtube.com/shorts/dQ8uUtuKFSI?feature=share) for a sneak preview of what's to come.

They are consistently updating their roadmap, so be sure to check frequently for updates!
