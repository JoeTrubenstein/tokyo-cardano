## The story goes that the now-famous Charles Hoskinson came up with the concept in a restaurant somewhere in Osaka.

From day one, Cardano has always been meant to be as Japan-centric as possible. The idea was essentially to create a more sustainable alternative to existing blockchain technologies - and to make it Japanese. So it only makes sense that CNFTs ( Cardano NFTs ) would follow the same logic.

Hence, the theme of this CNFT festival - [Japan Meets The West](https://cnft-festival.com/)."
