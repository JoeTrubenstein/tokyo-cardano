## The story goes that the now-famous Charles Hoskinson came up with the concept in a restaurant somewhere in Osaka.

From day one, Cardano has always been meant to be as Japan-centric as possible. The idea was essentially to create a more sustainable alternative to existing blockchain technologies - and to make it Japanese. So it only makes sense that CNFTs ( Cardano NFTs ) would follow the same logic. Hence, the theme of this CNFT festival from Japan.

The lineup boasts 34 speakers from the greater Cardano community.

But the boots-on-the-ground community organizer here in Japan goes by the name of Yunya and you should [follow her on twitter](https://twitter.com/BLUSTYURI1)!

She is working to connect artists, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts in both the Japanese and English speaking communities, here and abroad.

What makes a CNFT different from other NFTs?
Other NFT blockchains are problematic. Purchasing an NFT can come with high fees and long delays in transactions. Cardano works to solve these issues by minting its CNFTs as "native" assets.

When using another blockchain, your NFT is actually tied up inside of a smart contract - a bit of code with an index number that "points" to you as its owner.

CNFTs on the other hand, are treated by Cardano as if they were tokens themselves. This means you can keep your CNFTs directly in your ADA wallet.

As far as where to buy your CNFTs, look no further than [JPG store](https://www.jpg.store/) - who will be giving a presentation at the CNFT festival as well.
